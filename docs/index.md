# Grazel

**Grazel** stands for `Gradle` to `Bazel`. It is a Gradle plugin that enables you to migrate Android projects to [Bazel build](https://bazel.build) system in an incremental and automated fashion. 

## How it works

It works by automatically generating Bazel scripts for given Android project based on your Gradle configuration. For simple projects, it should be able to migrate, fully build and launch the app with `bazel mobile-install //<target-name>`. 

For example, for the following Gradle configuration:

```groovy
apply plugin: "com.android.library"
apply plugin: "kotlin-android"

android {
    compileSdkVersion rootProject.compileSdk

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion rootProject.minSdk
        targetSdkVersion rootProject.targetSdk
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation project(":app")
    implementation project(":base")
    implementation "androidx.test.espresso:espresso-idling-resource:3.2.0"
}
```

Grazel's `migrateToBazel` task generates the following Bazel build script:

```python
load("@io_bazel_rules_kotlin//kotlin:kotlin.bzl", "kt_android_library")

kt_android_library(
    name = "quiz",
    srcs = glob([
        "src/main/java/**/*.kt",
    ]),
    custom_package = "com.google.samples.apps.topeka.quiz",
    manifest = "src/main/AndroidManifest.xml",
    resource_files = glob([
        "src/main/res/**",
    ]),
    visibility = [
        "//visibility:public",
    ],
    deps = [
        "//app",
        "//base",
        "@maven//:androidx_test_espresso_espresso_idling_resource",
    ],
)

```

See [migration capabilities](migration_capabilities.md) for supported features. In advanced cases, where entire project might not be [migratable](migration_criteria.md), it migrates part of the graph and sets up [hybrid build](hybrid_builds.md) where part of the graph can be built with Bazel and rest with Gradle.

## Components

* [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/grab/Grazel/tree/master/grazel-gradle-plugin)
* A Kotlin Starlark DSL to generate Starlark code in a type-safe way.
* [Grab Bazel Common](https://github.com/grab/grab-bazel-common) - Custom rules to bridge the gap between Gradle/Bazel.

## Features

* Generate `BUILD.bazel`, `WORKSPACE` for given Android project and reduce the overall migration effort.
* Setup hybrid build to build part of project graph to build with Bazel and rest with Gradle.
* Minimal source changes to codebase - supported by [Grab Bazel Common](https://github.com/grab/grab-bazel-common).
* Gradle Configuration as source of truth.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildifier) is installed and avaialble in the path.

=== "Mac"
    Install via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 
    ```bash
    brew install buildifier
    ```
=== "Linux"
    Install via `apt` and `npm`. 
    ```bash 
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    npm i -g @bazel/buildifier
    ```

## Apply Grazel plugin

Grazel is available on Maven Central.

In root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.grab.grazel:grazel-gradle-plugin:0.1.0"
    }
}
apply plugin: "com.grab.grazel"

// Grazel configuration
grazel {
    // DSL
}
```

!!! Note
    Grazel registers `migrateToBazel` lifecycle task that can be used to generate Bazel build scripts. By default, it filters out modules based on a set of [migration criteria](migration_criteria.md) and generates scripts only for supported modules.

To run Grazel, execute

```
./gradlew migrateToBazel
```

For more advanced configuration options, see [Configuration](grazel_extension.md).
